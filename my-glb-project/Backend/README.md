## 🧩 Understanding Docker Compose and Override Files

Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using YAML files. Typically, you have a primary configuration file named `docker-compose.yml`. For environment-specific configurations (like development or testing), Docker Compose supports an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

### 🔄 How Overrides Work

When you execute `docker compose up`, Docker Compose automatically looks for both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`. It merges these files, with the override file's configurations taking precedence. This mechanism allows you to maintain a clean separation between your base configuration and environment-specific settings.

For more details, refer to the official Docker documentation on [merging Compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/).([Docker Documentation][2])

## ⚙️ Running Docker Compose for Different Environments

### 🚀 Production Environment

For production, you typically want to use only the base configuration without any overrides. You can achieve this by specifying the `-f` flag to indicate the file to use:([learn.microsoft.com][3])

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```



This command builds and starts the containers as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

### 🧪 Development Environment

In a development setting, you often need additional services, volume mounts, or environment variables. By default, Docker Compose looks for a `docker-compose.override.yml` file and merges it with the base configuration:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```



This command uses both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`, applying the overrides specified.

If you have multiple override files or differently named files, you can specify them explicitly:([learn.microsoft.com][3])

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```



In this case, configurations in `docker-compose.dev.yml` will override those in `docker-compose.yml`.

## 🛠️ Practical Example: Production vs. Development

### 📄 `docker-compose.yml` (Base Configuration)

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: myapp-backend:latest
    environment:
      - ENV=production
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    command: ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```



### 📄 `docker-compose.override.yml` (Development Overrides)

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app/app
      - ./scripts:/app/scripts
      - ./pyproject.toml:/app/pyproject.toml
      - ./uv.lock:/app/uv.lock
      - ./alembic.ini:/app/alembic.ini
    environment:
      - ENV=development
    command: >
      uvicorn app.main:app
      --host 0.0.0.0
      --port 8000
      --reload
      --reload-dir /app/app
    depends_on:
      - db
      - mailcatcher

  db:
    image: postgres:17
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: app_dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  mailcatcher:
    image: schickling/mailcatcher
    ports:
      - "1025:1025"  # SMTP
      - "1080:1080"  # Web UI

volumes:
  pgdata:
```



In this setup:

* The `backend` service mounts local directories for live code reloading.
* Additional services like `db` (PostgreSQL) and `mailcatcher` are included for development purposes.

---

## 🧰 Additional Tips

* **Detached Mode**: To run containers in the background, use the `-d` flag:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```



* **Rebuilding Services**: To rebuild a specific service, specify its name:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build backend
  ```



* **Stopping Containers**: To stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
